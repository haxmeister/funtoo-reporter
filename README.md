**You can send your report to the elastic search database using the send option which will return a link to the data if successful:**

'funtoo-report send'

```your report can be seen at: http://elk2.liguros.net:9200/funtoo-2018.10/report/C5DOC2IB4MpucymM_TFy```

**You can get HTTP debugging output for the send command with the `-d` or `--debug` option:**

'funtoo-report -d send'

### Manual Configuration:

The reporting tool is completely anonymous and the individual categories that
are in the report can be turned off or on by editing the config file. The
config file is located at /etc/funtoo-report.conf and will be autogenerated by
the script if one is not present. All lines of the config file that are empty
or start with # are ignored. The rest are read but may be ignored if they do
not match any expected setting. You can manually change the settings from 'y'
to 'n' to disable a particular category. Using the show-json option, you can
confirm that this portion of the report is not being output, since the
show-json option actually shows exactly what is reported to elasticsearch.

**Here is an example of all possible values in the config file**

```perl
# To report kernel info including O.S. type, release and version
kernel-info:y

# Allows the reporter to search your /boot directory and list
# any kernels it finds
# (limited to kernel names that start with "kernel" or "vmlinuz")
boot-dir-info:y

# To report versions of key softwares on your system including
# portage, ego, python, gcc, and glibc
version-info:y

# To report the contents of /var/lib/portage/world
world-info:y

# To report profiles information
# the same as epro show-json
profile-info:y

# To report kit versions as reported by ego
# extracted from ego kit show
kit-info:y

# To report all installed packages (takes a few secs)
installed-pkgs:y

# To report hardware info as is typical from lspci
hardware-info:y
```

### Uninstall
